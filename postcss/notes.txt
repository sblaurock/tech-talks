1. What is a CSS preprocessor?
  - Native CSS lacks functionality, so we aim to extend it
  - All in all allows you to write more modular, functional, maintainable styles
  - Browser cannot understand this code natively (*), must be compiled into readable code
  - CSS4 has variables natively, but none of the other things that make preprocessors popular
  - We can do simple math via CSS calc function, but this doesn't quite compare to what we get with pre-processing

2. What is PostCSS and how is it different?
  - PostCSS includes only the tools you need to have a CSS preprocessor, but none of the actual modifiers
  - Completely driven by plugins. Works just like Sass or Less, except the feature set is entirely driven by the plugins you add to your project
  - “PostCSS itself is very small. It includes only a CSS parser, a CSS node tree API, a source map generator, and a node tree stringifier.”
  - PostCSS is written in JavaScript, resulting in it being faster than libsass (C++). Better news, you can write your plugins in JavaScript

3. Comparison
  - Both
    - Integration with build tools (Gulp, Grunt)
    - Allow usage of latest functional patterns to CSS
    - Source map support
  - Sass, Less, SCSS
    - Consistent feature set, predictable usage
    - Maturity, adoption
      - Developers have it in their toolbelt
  - PostCSS
    - More easily extensible, greater freedom
      - Could lead to difficulty debugging and maintaining since feature sets across stacks will differ
    - Plugins written in JS instead of libsass (C++)
      - Easier to extend
    - Faster
      - Speed may not be a drastically important factor - most preprocessors are quite fast in most situations

4. Integration / Build Process
  - PostCSS will integrate with essentially any modern build tool
  - [DEMO] Integration with example Gulp workflow
    - Node environment set up with NPM and Gulp
    - Bootstrap example page with two CSS files, one for the Bootstrap library and one for custom styles
      - `npm install gulp gulp-rename gulp-watch` to install Gulp and dependencies
      - `npm install gulp-postcss` to install PostCSS
      - `npm install postcss-simple-vars` to install our first plugin that allows us to use Sass-like variables

5. But what if...
  - Using React? There's a plugin to evaluate CSS in JS
  - You can apply PostCSS to inline and in-page style definitions
  - Run PostCSS via the command line

5. Achieving Sass Feature Set
  - Yes, we can mostly achieve the full Sass featureset within PostCSS
    - If we search for all the features Sass offers, there are PostCSS plugin solutions for each one that will get us close
  - PreCSS is a bundle of plugins that does a much better job of providing all the same functionality that Sass offers
  - [DEMO] Integration of PreCSS into Gulp workflow
    - `npm install precss` to install PreCSS

6a. PostCSS Plugins (gracefully degrading)
  - What do you get that Sass won't provide
  - autoprefixer: Automatically add vendor prefixes from Can I Use
    - `npm install autoprefixer`
    - You can specify a list of browsers or selections (last 2 versions, > 5%)
  - oldie: IE fallbacks
    - `npm install oldie`
  - [DEMO] Integration of tools into Gulp workflow

6b. PostCSS Plugins (looking forward)
  - Transforms new CSS specs into more compatible CSS so you don't need to wait for browser support.
  - Write future-proof CSS now
  - Feature set
  - Autoprefixer fallbacks
  - [DEMO] Integration of cssnext into Gulp workflow
    - `npm install cssnext`

6c. PostCSS Plugins (tooling around)
  - CSS minification via cssnano
  - CSS linting via stylelint
  - Reporting
    - CSS statistics via cssstats
    - Modernizr support matrix via css2modernizr
    - Caniuse Browser support via doiuse

6d. PostCSS Plugins (simply awesome)
  - Colors
    - Simulate colorblindness
    - Maintain consistent color palette via colorguard
  - Images
    - Add Instagram filters

6e. PostCSS Plugins (fun)
  - Australian CSS syntax
  - Imperial length measurements
  - postcss.parts
